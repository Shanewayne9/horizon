changes: 
  - rscadd: "Turfs can now be ignited and will slowly burn, igniting anyone on them"
  - rscadd: "Hotspots have 30% chance to ignite a turf, making fiery explosions leave cool residual flame."
  - balance: "Flamethrowers have been reworked to use chemicals instead and now leave fire and hotspots on the turfs. They require an open reagent container instead of plasma tank now."
  - balance: "Firealarms now trigger from 80*C upwards (from 200*C) or -10*C downwards (from -3*C). They also trigger immediately when they're on a turf fire"
